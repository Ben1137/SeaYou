## 🚀 Deployment

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages.

### How It Works

1. Push changes to the `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions automatically builds the app
3. Deploys to GitHub Pages (usually takes 2-3 minutes)
4. Live site updates at: https://ben1137.github.io/SeaMe/

### Deployment Configuration

- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Build Tool**: Vite with base path `/SeaMe/`
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (free, HTTPS enabled)

### Manual Deployment

You can also trigger a deployment manually:

1. Go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/Ben1137/SeaMe/actions)
2. Select "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
3. Click "Run workflow"

## 🌍 Configuration

### API Integration

No API keys are required for the default Open-Meteo integration. The app makes client-side requests to:
